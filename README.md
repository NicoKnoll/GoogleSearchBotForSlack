# GoogleSearchBotForSlack
A Google Search Integration For Slack

### How to install
1. Put the files on your server
2. Create a new Slack Slash Command with whatever you want. Mine is /lmgtfy for example. Make it point to the "google.php" file. Keep the POST method. Add a description/hint if you want to.
3. Create an incoming webhook (choose any channel - it's reset by the script anyway) and paste the Webhook URL you'll get in the config file.
